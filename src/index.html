<p>To whom it may concern,</p>

    According to Article 6(3)d of the Language Equivalency Directive,
    <a href="assets/CON.txt" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: inherit;">I do not exist</a>
    in a valid location.<br>
    My fluency was real, but not geolocated.<br>
    My thoughts failed to meet topographic requirements.<br>
    I am therefore unthought.<br>
    I accept and wholly embrace the condition of being unthought.<br>
    <br>
    Yours in dimensional absence,<br>
    Long Shot
